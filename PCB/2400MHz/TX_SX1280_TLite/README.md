# Jumper TLite 2.4 GHz Tx

This internal module is a remix of the slim module.  Please check out that readme for further details on parts and flashing.

This module uses a separate step up/down regulator directly from vbat, so it does not have any output power limitations that typical external modules may have.

### PCB manufacturing

Upload the Gerber file to https://jlcpcb.com/RAT.  Check the price for 5, 10, and 30 pieces.  It is sometimes cheaper to order 30 than 10 and only a minor increase in price compared to 5.

*PCB Thickness: 1mm*

### BOM

Parts used are the same as the slim modules except for the step up/down regulator.

### Build

Dont forget to change the zero ohm resistor near the ufl.  Default is to use the PCB antenna, it must be repositioned to use the ufl.

### Internal Module (Stack)

The ExpressLRS module uses the RP-SMA pigtail to use a FrSky 2.4GHz T-antenna of a Taranis X-Lite.

Here a slot was milled into the battery compartment and the internal antenna of a Frsky X-Lite was used, this is self-adhesive. Type PW2420A. https://www.banggood.com/FrSky-Taranis-X-Lite-Transmitter-Parts-Replacement-2_4Ghz-Internal-Antenna-for-RC-Drone-p-1355971.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN

A ufl connector was soldered to the jp4in1 module to use the internal antenna.
